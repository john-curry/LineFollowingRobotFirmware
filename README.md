Bare-bones starting point for project. So far only toggles the GPIO pins PD12 and PD13.

Put this in the Project Folder of the stm32\_discovery\_arm\_gcc\
ie on my computer:
  /home/src/bigboss/src/stm32\_discovery\_arm\_gcc/STM32F4-Discovery\_FW\_V1.1.0/Project/

and for OSX:
  /Users/bigboss/src/stm32\_discovery\_arm\_gcc/STM32F4-Discovery\_FW\_V1.1.0/Project/

Coding Conventions:
  All structs are typedef with capitals for the first letter.
  All methods are capitalized at the second word.
  Multiple words are spaced with underscores.
  References and pointers are not capitalized.
  Openning brackets go on same line as keyword.
